# 2026-02-01 Daily Notes

## Setup Completed
- Git repository: https://github.com/yunhongfeng-tracy/clawdbot-conf
- FFmpeg 7.0.2 installed for audio processing
- OpenAI Whisper (local) installed for speech-to-text

## Cron Tasks Set Up
| Task | Time | Content |
|------|------|---------|
| Morning learning | 08:30 | Daily English learning materials |
| Midday reminder | 12:00 | Water/break reminder |
| Water reminder | 18:30 | Drink water |
| Evening check | 21:00 | Learning progress check |

## English Learning Plan Started
- Tracy's level: B1-B2 (intermediate)
- Goal: Reading improvement (AI content)
- Daily time: 15-30 minutes
- Preferences: Reading + audio
- Test completed, awaiting Day 1 plan

## Issues Found - CRITICAL BUG
### Cron Task Not Firing (23:20 Test)
- **Time**: 23:20 Beijing time
- **Task**: 23:20测试提醒 (job ID: 6089e8d0-cce1-47a5-b4f7-4a15b6301501)
- **Expected**: Message "🧪 23:20 测试提醒" should be sent
- **Actual**: 
  - System display claimed message was sent at 23:20:00
  - Tracy confirmed NOT receiving the message
  - Log analysis shows: **Cron trigger never fired at all**
  - Last cron activity: 23:15:35 (when processing `cron list` command)
  - At 23:20:00: No log entry for cron trigger

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Immediate messages**: Work fine (tested multiple times)
- **Scheduled cron tasks**: Bug confirmed - tasks not triggering at scheduled time
- **Previous symptom**: ~4 hour delay on earlier task (same root cause)

### Recommended Fix
- **Restart Gateway service** - to clear any queue/state issues
- **Command**: `kill -9 <gateway_pid>` then `openclaw gateway start`

### Impact
- All 4 regular cron tasks may be affected (08:30/12:00/18:30/21:00)
- Cannot rely on timed reminders until fix is applied

## Tools Configured
- FFmpeg path: /usr/bin/ffmpeg
- Whisper: /usr/local/bin/whisper (model: tiny)
- Speech-to-text script: /root/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/speech-to-text.sh
